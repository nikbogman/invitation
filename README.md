# Prom invitations ðŸŽ“

A simple online prom invitation service.  

The procedure is simple.  

1. Teachers will receive a physical invite with a QR code within it
2. They will get directed to a web page with a simple choice of "I'm attending" or "I'm not attending"

That's it!!!

Now here comes the installation part.

For the backend go to the `py/` subfolder and do `pip install -r requirements`. From there on you could just run `./manage.py runserver` and you're done.

For the front end go to the `js/` subfolder and do `npm install`. From there on you could just run `npm start` and you're done.
